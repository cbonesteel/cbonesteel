### Hey, my name is Cameron
#### I'm a computer science student at the University of Georgia! Go Dawgs!
#### I'm a software developer and the MOCI Program Manager at UGA's <a href="http://smallsat.uga.edu/">Small Satellite Research Lab</a>.
#### I'm currently interning for [Tall Timbers Research Station](https://talltimbers.org/) working on [fire modeling](https://github.com/QUIC-Fire-TT/ttrs_quicfire).

<hr/>

I like challenging myself with new projects either big or small. My coding 
projects tend to be for the challenge, to learn a new library, or just to 
have fun with some friends.
